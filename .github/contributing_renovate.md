## Security / Disclosure

If you find any bug with Renovate that may be a security problem, then e-mail us at: [renovate-disclosure@mend.io](mailto:renovate-disclosure@mend.io).
This way we can evaluate the bug and hopefully fix it before it gets abused.
Please give us enough time to investigate the bug before you report it anywhere else.

Please do not create GitHub issues for security-related doubts or problems.

## Support

If you want help with your Renovate configuration, go to the [discussions tab in the Renovate repository](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/discussions) and open a new "config help" discussion post.

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

**Bugs**: First search for related bugs in the issues and discussions, if you don't find anything then:

1. Create a [minimal reproduction](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/blob/main/docs/development/minimal-reproductions.md)
1. Open a new _discussion_ and link to the minimal reproduction

For **feature requests**: first search for related requests in the issues and discussions, if you don't find anything: create a _discussion_.

## Rate Limiting of Support Requests through Temporary Blocking

To ensure that the Renovate maintainers don't burn out from dealing with unfriendly behavior, those who display a bad attitude when asking for or receiving support in the repo will be rate limited from further requests through the use of temporary blocking.
The duration of the temporary block depends on how rude or inconsiderate the behavior is perceived to be, and can be from 1-30 days.

If you have been blocked temporarily and believe that it is due to a misunderstanding, or you regret your comments and wish to make amends, please reach out to the lead maintainer Rhys Arkins by email with any request for early unblocking.
If/once you are unblocked, you should edit or delete whatever comment lead to the blocking, even if you did not intend it to be rude or inconsiderate.
Long emails or apologies are undesirable - the maintainers are busy and want to be able to help as many users as possible with the time they have available.
